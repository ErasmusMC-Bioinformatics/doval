packaging ?

visualisation first
make powerpoint of plots


upload data --> pandas reads in dataframe --> django send dataframe to doval api --> 
doval api gets table element and web components --> django sends web componentns to template

class
	Viral
	Bacterial

1d data visualisation aproach:
	check datatypes from pandas df ->
		-> string data or bool data: make tuple of header and string -> count occurences of each string in dataset -> create bar chart of number of occurences.
		-> integer or float date: count unique values -> calculate amount of bins to group data into (datapoints /10), minimal 10. -> group all datapoints into bins -> display bins as bar chart.
	options: bar chart

2d data visualisation:
	options: line plot, box and whiskers, scatter plot, bar, pie chart, venn?

3d data visualisation:
	options: heatmap, scatter with histogram, 3d scatter, stacked bar, multi-line, combinations?

Hooking the notebook up to diferent sources:
	can be used by a single user inside of jupyter
	can be used by multi users inside of myfair
	can be used by multiple users inside of galaxy


doval linked to seek:

- take id from seek with dataset
- export id to seek with dataset (seek api)

make powerpoint with test cases.
	- show data formatting
	- show data transformation
	- show data filter

for user management: 
	create new session for id, no id is blank page

work on exporter functionality

gave feedback on canvasxpress github

visualisation tool: if someone shares his dataset by excel you don't know what happened to it. in this you can track what you did.
if someone wants to reproduce your r project he needs to install all your packages, in the right version number first then it can still be different. with this tool you can check your dataset without installing anything.

canvasx v 23.5 04/04. Author responded to questions fix to some problems coming in 23.6. 

why is it better than existing tools?
